Contributors: The WHO Nutrition Guidelines Expert Advisory Group Subgroup on Diet and Health discussed and developed the priority questions to be covered by the review in March 2011, and subsequently developed the protocol to answer those questions. NJA, HG, and SH ran the searches. HG and SH carried out the assessment of inclusion, data extraction, and validity assessment, with input from NJA. HG and NJA did the data analyses. NJA developed the first GRADE evidence profiles. NJA prepared the first draft of the report submitted for review by the WHO Nutrition Guidelines Expert Advisory Group Subgroup on Diet and Health, with support from HG and SH. The WHO Nutrition Guidelines Expert Advisory Group Subgroup on Diet and Health reviewed earlier drafts and contributed to the analysis and GRADE assessment.

Acknowledgments: We thank the participants in SHARP and the local clinical centre staff, regional and national coordinators, steering committee, and data monitoring committee. The study was funded by Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals (North Wales, PA, USA), with additional support from the Australian National Health Medical Research Council, the British Heart Foundation, and the UK Medical Research Council. JE acknowledges support from the British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence (Oxford, UK; RE/08/04). Role of the funding source: The main funding source (Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals) participated in initial discussions about trial design, contributed two non-voting observers to the steering committee, and had a right to comment on (but not require changes to) study reports. It had no involvement in data collection, analysis, and interpretation, report writing, or the decision to submit for publication, and will not receive an unmasked copy of the trial database. Voting members of the steering committee, all of whom are authors, accept full responsibility for the content of this paper.

G Enwere was clinical coordinator for most of the trial, participated in revision of the protocol, interpreted all radiographs, and had primary responsibility for clinical training and quality control. S Jaffar participated in study design and led the statistical analysis. O S Levine participated in study design and implementation and in writing the analytical plan. J B Okoko, C Oluwalana, and A Vaughan were responsible for clinical and safety surveillance, clinical training, and quality control. S K Obaro participated in study design, was initial project leader and set up and coordinated clinic-based field work until March, 2001. A Leach participated in study design, organised mapping of the study area, and set up and coordinated village-based field-work for the first 8 months of the trial. K P McAdam was co-principal investigator at the start of the trial and supported implementation for most of the study. E Biney ran the field laboratory and supervised microbiological and haematological procedures. M Saaka did serological assays. U Onwuchekwa was data manager.

N F Pierce chaired the international steering committee and participated in all phases of the trial. B M Greenwood had the idea for the study, wrote the original protocol, obtained the grant, and was co-principal investigator for the first year and scientific adviser for the duration of the trial. R A Adegbola participated in study design, coordinated and supervised all laboratory aspects of the trial, and was acting principal investigator from March to May, 2001. A Akano (consultant radiologist) interpreted all radiographs. B Hunter designed the new data management system in 2001 with input from U Onwuchekwa, F T Cutts, and S M A Zaman. A Njie was Expanded Programme on Immunization programme manager during the vaccination phase of the trial. M Touray was project administrator and supported trial implementation. A B Darbo and P Suso coordinated fieldwork and its quality control and served as community liaison officers. Conflict of interest statement: SKO has received honoraria from Wyeth Vaccines for consultancies in the past 3 years. Since her involvement in the trial, AL has become an employee of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, who are developing a pneumococcal vaccine, and owns shares in GlaxoSmithKline. The other authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. Acknowledgments: We dedicate this report to the late Rick Spiegel, Children's Vaccine Program at Programme for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), for his support to The Gambia Pneumococcal Vaccine Trial and commitment to improving the lives of children worldwide. Role of the funding source: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was involved in the design of the trial and analytical plan, organised trial monitoring by an independent contractor and the data safety monitoring board, and was the sponsor of the study that was done under an Investigational New Drug Application with the FDA. WHO organised an international steering committee that, in addition to the data safety monitoring board, closely reviewed the conduct and results of the trial.

No other authors reported financial disclosures. Funding/Support: This study was funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. Independent Statistical Review: All study data were transferred from Hoffman-La Roche to the Department of Statistics at the British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital for independent reanalysis. Statistical reanalyses of the raw data were performed by Ruth Milner and Victor M. Espinosa, MSc. There were only minor discrepancies between the reanalysis and the original interpretation of the results and conclusions. When there was a discrepancy Dr Chanoine included the results from the reanalyses performed at the British Columbia Children\u2019s Hospital. Role of the Sponsor: Hoffmann-La Roche was involved in the study design and conduct and in the analysis and interpretation of the data. All data were independently reanalyzed by an academic statistician. The sponsor was permitted to review the manuscript, but the final decision on content was with the corresponding author in conjunction with the other authors. Participating Investigators: J.
